# Fancy SGV Logo Maker

## Description
_______________________________________
This is a simple [SVG](http://www.w3.org/2000/svg) logo maker. The logo can have three characters.  You can select between three different shapes: triangle, square, and circle.

This application uses node.js, the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package (CLI tool), and the [jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework for integration and developing.

Cheers!

## Usage
_______________________________________

The application has simple entries for the README title,  and contact info (email, Github user). 

For the other fields (description, installation and usage), it will open your default text editor for
usage and instructions. For Windows, this is set during git bash installation and can be modified on the config globals:

	$ ```git config --global core.editor "code --wait" for vs code```

- Note: ```you should be available open vs code from the terminal. This can be achieved by adding it to the PATH```
- Note: ```If there is no text editor set, the default is Vim.```
